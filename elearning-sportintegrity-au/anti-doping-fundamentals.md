# ANTI-DOPING OVERVIEW
## What is Doping?
Doping is the use of substances or methods that are banned in sport. Doping is cheating because it gives one athlete an advantage over others. Doping is also extremely dangerous to your health and can destroy your reputation.

## So, what is Anti-Doping?
Anti-doping is a set of rules designed to protect athletes’ rights to participate in sport free of performance enhancing drugs. It’s anti-doping that keeps sport fair and keeps the playing field level. When athletes choose not to dope, we say they compete clean.

## Why does clean sport matter?
Clean fair sport is about creating an equal playing field for all athletes. It's about ensuring that athletes are rewarded for their hard work dedication skill and talent and it's about ensuring that sport remains about competing in a sport that you love rather than achieving a result by any means possible. Following the anti-doping rules and understanding the importance of drug testing is important in order to catch cheats and protect clean athletes. Clean fair sport is not only important in protecting the health and safety of athletes but also in ensuring that all of our hard work that goes into training and performing on competition day isn't taken away by someone who's cheating or not following the rules. I want to know that whatever my result is in a competition it's come down to my training and dedication.

## WHO MAKES THE ANTI-DOPING RULES
The anti-doping rules aren’t written by Sport Integrity Australia. The World Anti-Doping Code (the Code) is the core document which brings together anti‑doping rules and regulations. It is written by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in consultation with stakeholders, including governments, international sporting federations, and athletes around the world.

The Code is a set of international rules which apply to all athletes around the world. This means they are the same for everyone, no matter where you come from, where you compete, what level you compete at, or which sport you participate in. 

The rules are updated approximately every six years - the most recent version of the Code came into effect on 1 January 2021.

## Who is involved in Anti-Doping?
There are a range of different groups involved in anti‑doping. It is important to understand their roles and how they work together to create policies and rules that affect you.

### 1. World Anti-Doping Agency
The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) oversees the implementation of the Code, and makes sure all countries and sports that sign up to the rules are following them.

### 2. Sport Integrity Australia
Australia is one of 191 countries who are committed to the principles of the Code, and Sport Integrity Australia is responsible for implementing the rules to prevent doping in Australia and protect the sport we love! 

We conduct testing, investigate possible doping cases, are involved in legal proceedings, and educate Australian athletes and support staff about anti-doping.

### 3. National Sporting Organisations (NSO)
National Sporting Organisations (NSOs) have their own anti‑doping policies which are compliant with the Code, Sport Integrity Australia's requirements, and their International Federation’s requirements. 

NSOs are responsible for enforcing any bans on their athletes and support staff, to keep their sport clean.

### 4. YOU
All members of sport are bound by the anti‑doping policy of their NSO, and are therefore protected by the rules. This ensures all athletes compete in a safe and fair environment.

International Federations (IFs) and Major Games also have their own Code-compliant anti-doping policies. These are applicable to each sport, or during major events like the Olympics and Commonwealth Games.

## DID YOU KNOW?
It’s not just athletes who need to know the rules! Over half of the anti-doping rules apply to coaches and support staff too.

- If an athlete dopes, they have an unfair advantage over their competitors, so it’s important that the rules apply to them.
- Coaches can have a major influence on an athlete’s decision making about anti‑doping issues. Coaches could help, or force, their athletes to dope. It’s important that the rules apply to coaches too because it is their responsibility to improve their athlete’s performance fairly and safely.
- Like coaches, support staff play a vital role in an athlete’s career. They help treat and manage injuries, provide dietary advice, manage or lead teams, and help athletes maintain their health and fitness. Support staff have a responsibility to ensure any advice they give and any medications or products that they recommend adhere to anti-doping rules, because this can impact the athlete’s health and safety.

People who aren’t athletes or support staff may be bound by the rules too. This includes, but isn’t limited to, high performance staff, board members, and even Sport Integrity Australia staff. 

Everyone is included in the rules to make sure sport stays clean, safe and fair at all levels, for all people involved.

## REMEMBER
1. WADA, Sport Integrity Australia and sporting organisations work together to create and administer the anti-doping policies and rules that affect you.
2. The World Anti-Doping Code is the document that makes sure athletes in all sports and all countries are bound by the same rules.
3. Athletes, coaches and support staff all have rights and responsibilities when it comes to anti-doping.

# The Rules
This module covers the anti-doping rules all members of sport must follow. You need to know this to make sure you don't accidentally break a rule and face a ban without knowing it.

In this section, and others, you may see new words that are important to explain before we continue:
- ‘Prohibited’ means something CAN’T be used or IS NOT allowed (e.g. a prohibited substance or method)
- ‘Permitted’ means something CAN be used or IS allowed (e.g. a permitted substance or method)
- ‘Methods’ are ways that substances are used or given (e.g. through injection, inhaler, IV etc.)
- ‘Anti-Doping Rule Violations’ are the 11 anti-doping rules that can lead to a Sanction.
- ‘Sanction’ means the penalties that apply if you break a rule.

There are eleven anti-doping rules, known as Anti-Doping Rule Violations. Lets have a look at each one:

## 1. Presence
### Test positive for a prohibited substance 
**Example:**
An athlete was tested and returned a positive result for Higenamine. As Higenamine is prohibited, the athlete was banned from sport because it was present in their sample. 

This rule applies to athletes only.

## 2. Use or Attemped use
### Use or attempted use of a prohibited substance or method 
**Example:**
The athlete ordered Clenbuterol online. Clenbuterol is prohibited so when Border Force found the package, they informed us. After an investigation, the athlete received a ban from the sport for attempted use of a prohibited substance. 

This rule applies to athletes only.

## 3. Evasion or Refusal
### Evading testing, refusing or failing to provide a sample 
**Example:**
An athlete was notified that they had been selected for doping control however refused to be tested. The athlete was banned from sport for refusing to provide a sample without a compelling justification.

This rule applies to athletes only.

## 4. Whereabouts
### A combination of three missed tests and/or filing failures within 12 months (for Registered Testing Pool athletes)
**Example:**
An athlete on the Registered Testing Pool (RTP) advised they would be available for testing at their home, every day between 7-8am. When testing staff arrived at this time, the athlete wasn’t home and a “missed test” was declared. The athlete already had two missed tests declared within the last 12 months, and this was the 3rd, so the athlete was banned from sport for having three whereabouts failures in a 12 month period.

This rule applies to athletes on a Registered Testing Pool (RTP).

## 5. Tempering
### Tampering or attempted tampering with any part of the doping control process
**Example:**
A coach intimidated doping control officials, refused to allow her athlete to be tested and then drove her home. The coach was banned from all sport for tampering with the doping control process. In this case, the athlete may have also received a ban from sport for refusing or failing to provide a sample. 

This rule applies to athletes and other persons bound by the Code.

## 6. Possession
### Possession of a prohibited substance or method 
**Example:**
An athlete was returning from an international competition when their bag was searched by Border Force. A prohibited substance was found in their luggage and, as they did not have an approved TUE, the athlete was banned from sport for the possession of a prohibited substance.

This rule applies to athletes and support staff.

## 7. Trafficking
### Trafficking or attempted trafficking of a prohibited substance or method 
**Example:**
A coach ordered a large quantity of prohibited substances online with plans to give them to his athletes. Border Force found the package and the coach was banned from sport for attempted trafficking. 

This rule applies to athletes and athlete support persons bound by the Code.

## 8. Administration
### Administration or attempted administration of a prohibited substance or method 
**Example:**
An athlete receives a blood transfusion from a team doctor to improve her performance. The team doctor could be banned from sport for administration.

This rule applies to athletes and other persons bound by the Code.

## 9. Complicity
### Complicity or attempted complicity
**Example:**
The manager of a team knows his athletes are doping. When testing officials arrive, the manager tells the athletes to leave so they won’t be tested. The manager could be banned from sport for complicity.

This rule applies to athletes and other persons bound by the Code.

## 10. Prohibited association
### Knowingly associating in a sporting context with an athlete support person who is serving a ban
**Example:**
A coach has been banned from sport for breaking one of the rules. The athlete is aware that the coach has been banned, and the athlete continues to receive coaching from this coach. The athlete may receive a ban from sport for prohibited association.

This rule applies to athletes and other persons bound by the Code.

## 11. Acts to discourage or retaliate against reporting
### Acts to discourage or retaliate against reporting to authorities
**Example:** An athlete sees their teammate using a prohibited substance. The athlete tells their teammate that they will report this to Sport Integrity Australia, and the teammate threatens to harm the athlete if they report it. The teammate may receive a ban from sport for discouraging against reporting.

This rule applies to athletes and other persons bound by the Code.

## THE STRICT LIABILITY PRINCIPLE
As an athlete, you might be thinking ‘but what if...’
- Someone gave it to me?
- I didn't know?
- My doctor prescribed it?

None of these excuses matter much.

It is the athlete’s responsibility to know the rules and to know what is going in their body at all times. This is called the Strict Liability Principle: athletes are held responsible for anything found in their bodies, regardless of how it got there.

Let's look at those reasons in more details:

## 1. Someone gave it to me
As an athlete, you are responsible for whatever is found in your sample - even if your coach, parent (or anyone else) gives it to you or says it’s OK.

You need to check every substance you put in your body before you use it.

## 2. I didn't know
As an athlete, you should know. In fact, you need to know! It is your responsibility to check everything BEFORE you use it.

## 3. It was prescribed to me
You might be prescribed a substance to treat a medical condition. Just because a substance has been prescribed does NOT mean it is permitted.

The Strict Liability Principle is important because it stops people from cheating and getting away with it by just blaming someone else. If you have a prohibited substance in your body, you will be held responsible for it and will have to explain how it got there.

## REMEMBER
- There are 11 Anti-Doping Rule Violations – all 11 apply to athletes and 7 apply to other persons bound by the Code.
- **STRICT LIABILITY** one the of the most important things to remember: an athlete is responsible for all substances found in their sample and will face the consequences if a prohibited substance is found.

# Prohibited substances and methods
In this module, you will learn about the Prohibited List, and how to find out if a substance or method is banned in sport. You need to know this to make sure you (or your athletes) don’t take a banned substance by accident.

## The Prohibited List
Each year, WADA publishes the Prohibited List, which identifies the substances and methods that are prohibited in sport. 

Before we find out more about prohibited substances and methods, let's listen to how a substance is selected for the Prohibited List.

## How does a substance end up on the prohibited list?
Prohibited list contains a broad range of substances from things like salbutamol in a ventilated puffer which is quite a common medication through to substances that haven't even cleared clinical trails like ASSAM. There are three criteria that are considered and a substance has to meet two of those three criteria to get onto the list.
### 1. The substance that enchances performance
**Example:**
If someone abuses EPO, then it increases the number of red blood cells in their body that enables you to transport more oxygen and it gives you an advantage in endurance sports above your competitors.

### 2. The substance that presents a risk to the health of athletes
**Example:**
So taking EPO again. EPO is naturally in our bodies but if we have elevated levels of it abnormally in our bodies then there are significant risks associated with that. Our blood actually becomes a lot thicker and theres is a risk of heart attacks and seizurees and people have even died from the use of that substance.

### 3. It's against the spirit of sport
WADA considers the spirit of sport to be the persuit of human excellence through the dedicated perfection of one's natural talents. If we think about EPO again if an athlete's using EPO their performance is not the result of their natural talent and hard work instead it's been contributed through the performance enhancing effects of EPO.

## Prohibited Substances
Prohibited Substances can range from over-the-counter products like some cold and flu medications to substances like steroids and growth hormones. Even some prescription medications are prohibited, such as, Diabetic Insulin, Ritalin for ADHD and even high blood pressure medication as some contain a diuretic, commonly hydrochlorothiazide (HTC).

## Prohibited Methods
Prohibited Methods are techniques that may give an athlete an unfair advantage. One example is blood doping, which involves injecting blood (either yours or someone else’s) into the body.

While blood is not a prohibited substance, changing its natural composition in the body by increasing the amount of red blood cells, is a prohibited method. 

Other prohibited methods include gene doping and even donating plasma! 

Certain types of intravenous infusions (IVs) and/or injections can also be prohibited, including receiving fluids via intravenous drip for rehydration. 

This is prohibited if the injection exceeds 100mL per 12-hour period, except for those legitimately received during a hospital treatment or surgical procedure.

## Not All Prohibited Substances and Methods are banned all the time.
There are three categories in the Prohibited List:
### 1. Prohibited at all times
Athletes are not permitted to take substances or use methods in this category at any time.

### 2. Prohibited in-competition
Some substances are only prohibited when an athlete is competing. These substances must be out of an athlete’s system before the in-competition period commences. 

The in-competition period begins at 11:59 p.m. the day before an athlete is due to compete, and extends until the end of the competition’s sample collection period. 

For some sports and events, the classification of the in-competition period may be different, so it always a good idea to check with your sport.

### 3. Prohibited in particular sports
Substances that are banned in certain sports. 

For example, beta-blockers, which reduce blood pressure and heart rate, are prohibited in target sports like archery, but not others like weightlifting, where it would not be an advantage.

**Remember:** Prohibited means something CAN’T be used or IS NOT allowed

## CASE STUDY
### Meet Jordan and Jess, two long-distance runners training for the upcoming athletics season.

For three weeks, Jordan trains twice a day at high altitude in preparation for the marathon. 

When she starts training, Jordan is short of breath and her muscles burn as the air is much thinner. 

As she continues to train, her body adapts to overcome these challenges by producing more red blood cells. 

When Jordan returns to a lower altitude, she finds she can perform better than she could before, because she has more red blood cells.

Jess also trains twice a day for three weeks however she can’t train at high altitude. 

Her coach suggests she uses Erythropoietin (EPO) as this can have the same effect as high altitude training, by creating more red blood cells.

Jess decides to use EPO so she can compete on a level playing field with Jordan (who trained at high altitude).

### What do you think?
Based on what you already know, do you think either Jordan or Jess have done anything wrong? 
**Ans:** Yes, Jess is enhancing their performance by taking a prohibited substance, while Jordan is legitimately undertaking altitude training.

## HOW TO CHECK SUBSTANCES
You may be thinking: “I know the Prohibited List exists, but it is really long, and I don’t understand the names of the substances – lots of them are just chemicals I have never heard of! How would I know if things I take are prohibited or not?”

To help you, Sport Integrity Australia has partnered with anti-doping organisations from other countries to create a website called Global DRO. On this website, you can search the name of  any registered Australian medication to find out if you can take them, and when.

### 1. Learn about GlobalDRO
GlobalDRO is the easiest way for athletes to check for themselves if something they want to take is permitted in sport. The search results page acts as a confirmation with a receipt number and date as proof for each substance you check.

### 2. Check products and methods
When checking medications on GlobalDRO, make sure you spell them correctly. You also need to make sure that the response you receive is an exact match to the term you are checking. 

If the product or method you are checking is not recognised, it does NOT mean it is permitted. In this case, contact Sport Integrity Australia to check your substance.

### 3. Record your results
Don’t forget to screenshot or save these pages for your records.

If your product isn’t in GlobalDRO it may be because it is a supplement. We’ll talk about how to check those in the Supplement section of this course.

Remember, STRICT LIABILITY is one of the most important rules for athletes: athletes should check everything that goes in their body before they use it.

## REMEMBER
Use GlobalDRO to check whether you can take a medication before you use it. Make sure you check every time you use a medication, as the list changes each year.

- The Prohibited List contains a list of substances and methods which are prohibited under the Code, and is updated annually.
- Common medications like cold and flu tablets or prescription medications can contain prohibited substances. Before taking anything check it online.
- Athletes can use GlobalDRO to determine if their medication includes a substance that is prohibited in sport.

# Therapeutic use exemptitons
What is a Therapeutic Use Exemption, are you eligible for one, and how do you apply? Find out by completing this module.

You need to know this because if you require a TUE but don’t have one, you can face a sanction.

At times, athletes may need to use a prohibited substance to treat a legitimate medical condition. For example, insulin is prohibited in sport, but some diabetics need it to live. 

A TUE is an exemption that allows an athlete to use, for therapeutic purposes only, an otherwise prohibited substance or method. 

However, there are strict rules around TUEs, and an exemption can only be granted if it meets the following criteria:
## 1. Avoid Health Problems
The athlete would experience significant health problems if they did not use the prohibited substance or method.

## 2. No Performance Advantage
The use of the substance or method would not result in performance enhancement, other than to return the athlete to a baseline state of health by treating the medical condition.

## 3. No Alternative
There is no reasonable permitted therapeutic alternative to the prohibited substance or method.

## 4. Not Caused by Prior Substance Use
The need to use a prohibited substance or method for a health reason must not be the result of using or having used a prohibited substance before (without a TUE). For example, you would not have an exemption approved to treat a condition like low testosterone, which was caused by previous steroid abuse.

## How do I apply for a TUE?
### Step 1
You tell your medical professional that you’re an athlete who could be drug tested and ask them to bear this in mind when prescribing medication.

### Step 2
Check the status of the medication by using GlobalDRO.

### Step 3
If the substance is prohibited, ask your doctor if there are any alternatives that could be used.

### Step 4
If there’s no reasonable alternative, you will need to prepare evidence for a TUE application with your doctor.

### Step 5
Check if you need an in-advance TUE or not by visiting the Sport Integrity Australia website, using the Sport Integrity App, or consulting with your International Federation (if you are an international level athlete). If you need an in-Advance TUE, follow the next steps to prepare your application. If you don’t need an in-advance TUE, keep all medical evidence handy in case you are tested, or asked by Sport Integrity Australia.

### Step 6
Download an application form or call us to check whether you need to apply to your International Federation.

### Step 7
Your application must be completed in full, including the medical section by your Doctor (Note that some applications require Specialist support).

### Step 8
Submit your application to Australian Sports Drug Medical Advisory Committee (ASDMAC) or send your TUE application to your International Federation if that’s appropriate. 

Post: PO Box 1744, Fyshwick ACT 2609
Email: asdmac@sportintegrity.gov.au

### Step 9
Your application will be reviewed. You may be contacted for further information if the information you provided was not sufficient. This may delay the processing of your application.

### Step 10
You and your medical professional will be told whether the application has been accepted or rejected. 

You will be told of any conditions including the date of expiry and restrictions on the use of the medication.

You have the right to request a review if unhappy with the decision.

### Medical Emergencies
In the case of emergency medical treatment, athletes do not need a TUE. Once the emergency is over, the athlete should contact ASDMAC to apply for a retroactive TUE if required.

### REMEMBER
- A TUE allows an athlete to take a prohibited substance for medical purposes.
- Athletes should contact ASDMAC or their International Federation to apply for a TUE.

# Supplements
Now that you have learnt that substances and methods can be prohibited or permitted, it is important to look closely at the risks associated with supplement use. As supplements are not medications, we cannot guarantee they are safe to use in sport.

## SUPPLEMENTS V REGISTERED MEDICATION

### What is the difference between a supplement and a medication?
### Medication
Registered medicines include products such as paracetamol, aspirin, asthma medications etc. These products are strictly regulated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, so you can be certain about exactly which ingredients are used. You can find these in GlobalDRO.

### Supplements
Supplements include things like protein powders, pre-work outs, vitamins, minerals, herbal products, as well as sport nutrition products and meal supplements. 

These are often purchased off the shelf from supermarkets, chemists, health food stores, supplement stores, gyms and via the internet. These types of products are not as strictly regulated as registered medicines and unfortunately you can’t be sure what is in your product. 

Some products might look like medications, but if you can’t find it in GlobalDRO, you can’t be sure what is in it.

## SUPPLEMENT RISKS
Approximately one athlete a month tests positive to a prohibited substance found in a supplement, and when this happens the ban from sport can be just as severe as a positive test to steroids. This means supplements are one of the biggest risks facing athletes in Australia!

While nutritional supplements are generally marketed as being healthy, taking supplements is risky because they can sometimes contain a prohibited substance.

There are two main reasons this can happen:
### 1. Inaccurate Labelling
Ingredients can be given confusing names or be left out entirely

### 2. Cross contamination
Prohibited substances can accidentally end up in the products

### Let's have a look at an example.
A common way supplements can be contaminated is through cross contamination in the factories that create supplements. You only need a tiny amount in a supplement to trigger a positive test, so if one product in a factory contains a banned ingredient, it increases the risk that others created by the same company might have the banned ingredient too.

- In 2020 OxyShred was a brand of supplement available in Australia and was marketed as a pre-workout. The Pina Colada flavoured OxyShred listed Higenamine on the label.  Higenamine is a prohibited substance. Other flavours of OxyShred, however, did not list Higenamine on the label. Because both products were created by the same company, it is possible that, like the Pina Colada, the other flavours of the same product contain Higenamine although it is not listed on the label.
- Now, let’s have a look at Blessed, a different supplement that’s also available off the shelf in Australia. According to the label, Blessed’s Chai flavoured protein is vegan and all natural. This might sound appealing, but does that mean it’s safe? Blessed is manufactured by the same company as OxyShred, meaning there is a risk of Higenamine appearing in Blessed due to cross-contamination.

## CAN SPORT INTEGRITY AUSTRALIA RECOMMEND SAFE SUPPLEMENTS TO USE?
Sport Integrity Australia is not the regulator of the supplements industry, and Sport Integrity Australia does not endorse or approve any supplement products. 

For this reason, it is simply not possible for us to advise athletes whether a specific supplement, or batch of supplements, is safe to use.

Instead, Sport Integrity Australia recommends the ‘Food First’ approach. A balanced diet of nutritious food is the safest way to enhance training and recovery. No one ever tested positive to a banana! 

A qualified professional, like a sports dietician, physician or doctor, can help you determine if you need to use a supplement, or if you can change your diet to maximise your performance.

## CASE STUDY
What began with a routine anti-doping test, ended with a nine-month sanction from all sport. 

Cassie found it difficult to combine her professional and athletic careers, so she took a supplement she thought was safe to use in sport.

## HOW CAN I AVOID THE RISK?
Eating the right food, in the right amounts, is one of the best ways to improve performance.

Many people believe that taking a sports supplement will be a ‘quick fix’ to athlete success.

Many don’t take into account that:
- Supplements can be very expensive
- Very few performance supplements are backed by evidence
- The use of supplements is unnecessary in most cases, and can pose risks to an athlete's health and career
- A balanced diet can usually give you all the energy your body needs

## RISKS OF SHARING KITCHEN EQUIPMENT
As well as inaccurate labelling and cross contamination of supplements, athletes have also tested positive through the use of shared kitchen equipment and utensils. 

For example, if your housemate makes a protein shake in a blender with a prohibited substance in it, if you also use that blender, you are at risk of ingesting that prohibited substance. 

This means you need to be wary of what supplements and prohibited substances are being used around you.

## WHAT IF I WANT OR NEED TO TAKE A SUPPLEMENT
Sport Integrity Australia understands that many athletes will still decide to use supplements. So how do you decide which one to use, or work out which ones are low risk? 

For those still considering using supplements, Sport Integrity Australia recommends choosing a batch tested supplement. Batch tested supplements are those which have been tested by a third party and are deemed to have no banned substances in them. 

However, this does not mean these supplements are 100% safe, because it is impossible for a lab to test for every single substance on the Prohibited List. Although there is no guarantee, batch testing significantly lowers the risk of the supplement containing a prohibited substance.

Sport Integrity Australia recognises HASTA and Informed Sport batch tested supplements. So, if you are going to take a supplement, always look for these logos and then verify the batch number. You can verify the batch number using the supplement checker on the Sport Integrity App or on the HASTA/Informed Sport website.

## THE SUPPLEMENT CHECKER
The Sport Integrity App contains a supplement checker function, which includes a list of batch tested supplements available for purchase in Australia. 

You can view a list of batch tested products before choosing which supplement to buy, or you can take a short survey to find out how risky a product is.

We’ll show you how to check supplements in the final module of this course.

More information about the effectiveness of supplements is available from the AIS website.

## REMEMBER
- Supplements are not regulated as heavily as registered medicines, meaning prohibited substances can appear in supplements by accident.
- Some supplements also include banned ingredients on purpose.
- Speak to a qualified professional, like a sports dietician, Physician or Doctor, to help you determine if you need to use a supplement, or if you can train or eat differently instead.
- Not all supplements have the same risk. The lowest risk supplements are batch tested. A list of these  supplements is included in the Sport Integrity App.
- Athletes are strictly responsible for any substance found in their system regardless of how it got there, and will face the consequences if a prohibited substance is found.

# Consequences

## WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES OF DOPING?
What happens if you dope? It doesn’t matter if you take a prohibited substance on purpose, or if something gets into your body by accident. The consequences are the same.

## What does it feel like to win as a result of doping?
Olympic gold medallist Tyler Hamilton describes how it felt to stand on the podium at the 2004 Athens Olympics, knowing his achievement was the result of doping.

## Sport Sanctions
As you know, individuals who break the rules can be banned from all sport. There are many other consequences of breaking the rules which can impact athletes, support personnel, and those around them.

### 1. Disqualification of results
Testing positive during an event may result in an automatic disqualification and a need to return any medals, points or prizes received. Testing positive out-of-competition, or other ADRVs, may result in results being disqualified from the date of the test or when the violation was committed.

### 2. Sanctions on individuals
The standard length of a ban for a serious offence is 4 years. This means you will be ineligible from participating in any sport competitions or activities under the Code, in any country, as an athlete, coach, manager, volunteer, employee or official (unless you are providing authorised anti-doping education or rehabilitation programs).

### 3. Sanctions on teams
During a competition period in team sports, if more than two team members break a rule, the entire team could be sanctioned. Sanctions may include losing points or disqualification. Team sanctions are additional to those received by the individuals who broke the rules.

### 4. Multiple violations
If an individual has previously broken a rule, the outcome of breaking further rules will vary based on the circumstances of the case (e.g. longer bans). 

### 5. Other cases and the sanctions
- During the Sydney 2000 Olympics, a team doctor was expelled for the remainder of the Games and banned from having a role in the next Olympics after giving a young athlete some cold and flu tablets that later caused her to return a positive test.
- In 2013 at a junior national championship, a coach encouraged an athlete to leave the doping control station after not being able to provide a sample after a long period of time. The coach was banned for two years for Complicity after being found to have encouraged  an anti-doping rule violation.
- In 2018, an Olympic US swimmer posed a photo of themselves on Instagram receiving an IV drip of Vitamin B. Whilst Vitamin B is not a prohibited substance, the method and amount administered was prohibited under the rules. The athlete was sanctioned for 14 months.
- In 2019, a Doping Control Officer attended a cycling athlete’s home to conduct an out of competition test. The athlete answered the door, and after being told he had been selected to provide an out of competition urine sample, replied that he was busy on a conference call and slammed the door shut. The DCO returned to his car and phoned the anti-doping organisation’s Legal Counsel for advice. The DCO knocked on the athlete’s door to attempt to get a sample, but the athlete did not answer. The athlete was sanctioned for four years for refusing to provide a sample.

## CASE STUDY
Athlete X is an Australian athlete who used a prohibited substance to help them recover from injury. 

They were given a four year ban which meant they couldn’t compete in any sport, at any level, anywhere in the world. But there were also other consequences.

### Economic Effects
Doping not only puts your sporting career at risk, but also your academic and professional aspirations. Athlete X, whose main source of income was coaching weightlifting, could no longer work in sport, which significantly affected their income.

### Doping Effects
For many athletes, sport creates friendships and social networks. By doping, you risk disappointing your loved ones, losing the respect of other sportspeople, and letting down fans who look up to you. When Athlete X was banned from sport, they lost their support structure of other athletes and coaches.

### Health Effects
When an athlete dopes, it is very difficult to determine the exact side effects that a substance or method may have on the athlete. 

Doping is a big risk to both physical and mental health. Athlete X began to suffer from depression and anxiety. They had lost their passion, their source of income, their friends and had put extra stress on their family.

For many people, sport is a huge part of life. It’s exercise, it’s social outings, it’s income, it’s a break from busy lives. You risk losing all of this by breaking the anti-doping rules.

## HEALTH CONSEQUENCES
When someone uses a prohibited substance, side effects can be serious and some are unknown, everyone can be affected differently.

- Research is rarely done on healthy people without a medical need to use the substance
- Substances/methods used to enhance performance are usually made to treat serious illnesses in people who are unwell and NOT made for healthy people
- Athletes who use prohibited substances often take them in higher doses or combinations than they have never been tested for safety or side effects, increasing the risk of health consequences
- Products which claim to enhance performance may be made illegally and contain ingredients that cause serious health problems (or death)

Let's take a look at some of the substances and their potential side effects:

### ANABOLIC AGENTS
Anabolic steroids are natural or artificial versions of ‘Testosterone’. Testosterone is a sex hormone that typically exists in males more than females. 
- Premature baldness
- Development of male features, voice, facial hair
- Liver and/or cardiovascular disease
- Shrinking testicles, reduced sperm production
- Enlarged clitoris
- Impotence, infertility

## EPO
EPO is a hormone produced by the kidneys to help produce red blood cells. Medically, synthetic EPO can be used to treat patients with specific types of anaemia.

### Health risks exist with EPO use
- Increased rikes of blood clots, stroke and heart attacks
- Increased risk of contracting infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV/AIDS from shared needles
- Thickened blood

## HUMAN GROWTH HORMONE (hGH)
Human growth hormone (hGH) is produced by the pituitary gland (below the brain) which can help growth.

### The dangerous side effects of hGH
- Increasing develpment of tumors
- Distorted growth of internal organs, bones and facial features
- Worsening of cardiovascular diseases
- Cardiomegaly (abnormal enlargement of the heart)
- Enlargement and thickening of fingers, toes, ears and skin
- Muscle, joint and bone pain

## Stimulants
Stimulants act on the central nervous system to mentally and physically stimulate the body. Stimulants include cocaine, ecstasy, ephedrine, and pseudoephedrine.

### How stimulants can cause serious cardiovascular and psychological problems.
- Anxiety and aggression
- Problems with co-ordination and balance
- Increased risk of stroke, cardiac arrhythmia and heart attack
- Tremors (involuntary trembling or shaking)
- Can result in dependence and addiction

## HEALTH EFFECTS OF DOPING AUGMENTED REALITY APP
If you want to see the health effects of doping on the human body in real time, take a look at Sport Integrity Australia’s award winning Health Effects of Doping Augmented Reality (AR) app. 

In this app, you create your own athlete avatar who will experience all the negative health effects of doping right before your eyes. Using your phone’s camera, you can peer inside your avatar to see how various Performance and Image Enhancing Drugs (PIEDs) change your heart, lungs and nervous system. 

You can also see the positive effects that good food, sleep and hydration have on your avatar. 

Once you’re finished, you can take the quiz and test your knowledge against your team mates.

## REMEMBER
- Doping doesn’t just mean a ban from sport. It affects your health, your career outside sport, and the people you love too.
- It doesn't matter if you intentionally committed an ADRV, or if it happens by accident. The consequences are the same.
- When your performance is the result of doping, you can lose your sense of pride and accomplishment knowing your achievement has come from cheating.

# Doping Control
In this section we will learn about drug testing, known as sample collection. 

The first thing you need to know is that your body keeps a record of what substances go into your body in things like your hair, blood and urine. Just like you might do a blood test at the doctor's office to detect a disease, anti-doping organisations can use blood and urine to detect whether an athlete has used any prohibited substances.

Key facts about testing:
- You don’t have to be an elite athlete to be tested. Any athlete who competes in a sport with an anti-doping policy can be tested.
- Athletes can be tested anywhere, anytime – at training, at home, at a game, even at work.
- Tests can be on either a urine sample, or a blood sample.

## THE DOPING CONTROL PROCESS
Hayley Baker is an Australian Swimmer who will describe what it’s like to be tested, and walk you through each step in the process.
### 1. Athlete selection and notification
### 2. Reporting to Doping Control and selecting a collection vessel
### 3. Providing a sample
### 4. Selection of collection kit and splitting the sample
### 5. Measuring the specific gravity
### 6. Final paperwork and transporting the sample.

## TYPES OF BLOOD TESTING
In 2023, a new method of collecting an athlete's blood was introduced. This new method is called Dried Blood Spot (DBS) testing. The traditional method of blood collection is called intravenous testing.

### Difference between intravenous blood testing and DBS testing
**Intravenous Testing**
An intravenous blood test is a sample withdrawn from a vein in the athlete’s arm, like a regular blood test at the doctor’s.
Blood is collected in tubes by a qualified nurse. 
The athlete seals the sample and it is sent to a WADA accredited lab for analysis.

**Dried Blood Spot Testing**
DBS sample collection uses a small amount of blood from a special device that attaches to an athlete’s upper arm (or in some cases a finger prick). 
The device is attached to the arm by the athlete, and the blood is collected and dried on absorbent material. 
The DCO securely seals the sample before it is sent to a WADA-accredited lab for analysis.

DBS won’t replace traditional blood or urine testing.

Although there are three sample collection methods, you don’t get to choose which one is used during your test, so make sure you follow the Chaperone or DCO’s instructions closely.

## TESTING RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES
Testing is a serious business. If anything goes wrong it could mean a ban from sport, so it’s important to take it seriously.

When it comes to testing, athletes have the responsibility to:
- Always remain within direct observation of their Chaperone; from the point when they are notified until the completion of the sample collection procedure
- Produce appropriate identification
- Comply with sample collection procedures and follow all instructions issued by Sport Integrity Australia staff
- Report immediately for a test, unless there is a valid reason for a delay (more on this below!)

Athletes have the right to:
- Have a representative present
- Have an interpreter, if available
- Ask for additional information about the sample collection process
- Request modifications if they are an athlete with a disability or a minor.

Athletes can request a delay in reporting to the doping control station to:
- Perform a warm down
- Participate in a victory ceremony
- Compete in further competitions
- Obtain necessary medical treatment
- Fulfil media commitments
- Obtain photo identification
- Complete a training session
- Locate a representative and/or interpreter

Athletes can also request a delay for any other exceptional circumstances as approved by Sport Integrity Australia provided they can be chaperoned at all times.

## DOPING CONTROL VIRTUAL REALITY
### What to know more?
You can test out the doping control process at home! We take you through the doping control process with our new, web based, Virtual Reality (VR) experience. Check it out by clicking on the button below, no VR headset required!

## WHO CONDUCTS TESTING MISSIONS?
Sport Integrity Australia conducts the majority of anti-doping testing in Australia, but there are other private companies who also conduct testing under contracts with international sporting federations or other anti-doping organisations.

Regardless of who is testing you – the process should be the same. You are entitled to ask who is testing you, and to see ID.

### What can athletes get wrong during the process?
#### 1. Not taking it seriously:
If you do something wrong during a test, you could commit an ADRV. It is important you follow the instructions of the DCO and Chaperone at all times.

#### 2. Leaving the sight of their chaperone:
Athletes must stay within sight of their chaperone at all times. Leaving the sight of your chaperone could be considered evasion, which carries a four year ban.

#### 3. Providing inaccurate information on paperwork:
Reporting incorrect details such as name, date of birth, phone numbers or addresses are examples of tampering with the doping control process. This rule violation can carry a four year sanction.

#### 4. Not providing their first urine sample:
Once notified for doping control, an athlete must provide the first urine sample that leaves their body.

### What if something goes wrong?
If the process above isn’t followed, you should report it on your testing paperwork. 

If that is uncomfortable, you can also report it to Sport Integrity Australia via the App, or via email. 

Remember – these documents can end up in an anti-doping tribunal hearing, so you should always report anything that concerns you.

## THE ATHLETE BIOLOGICAL PASSPORT
The Athlete Biological Passport (ABP) is another tool that we use to detect doping.

### What is the ABP?
The ABP is a record of an athlete’s biological values over time. It looks for the effects of doping, not the presence of prohibited substances.

### What is the ABP not?
The ABP is not a replacement for testing or intelligence and investigations. The ABP is used alongside other strategies to help reduce doping in sport.

### Rule violations
The ABP can prove that an athlete has used a prohibited substance or method.

### Collecting ABP samples
The process for collecting ABP samples is like the standard testing process.

## ATHLETE WHEREABOUTS
Athlete Whereabouts only applies to athletes assigned to a testing pool by Sport Integrity Australia or their International Federation (IF). These athletes need to provide and maintain whereabouts information so they can be found for testing at any time. 

Let’s look at the Athlete Whereabouts in more detail.

### How will atheletes know they are in a testing pool?
Athletes will be informed by Sport Integrity Australia (or their IF) and given more information about their whereabouts responsibilities.

Don’t worry you wont be on a testing pool and not know it. All athletes receive plenty of warning and support.

### What type of information do registered testing pool (RTP) and national testing pool (NTP) athletes need to provide?
Testing pool athletes need to provide and maintain:
- Their home address
- Addresses for training, work and any other regular activities (and timeframes for those activities)
- A competition schedule (with dates, locations and accommodation details, including room number)
- Any travel information (including destination, flight details and dates of travel)
- Any temporary or alternative addresses (e.g. when on holiday or partner’s address)
- RTP athletes are also required to provide a nominated 60 minute time slot and location.

### How does this contribute to anti-doping?
It allows us to perform regular out-of-competition testing on athletes and this helps us reduce or eliminate doping from sport.

## REMEMBER
- All people who meet Sport Integrity Australia’s definition of 'Athlete', can be tested anywhere, any time.
- If something unusual happens during a test, report it on the doping control form.
- Athletes are entitled to have a support person with them during the testing process.
- Not following the testing procedure, or instruction from doping control staff, can result in an ADRV. You must take the process seriously.

# Intelligence & Investigations
Sport Integrity Australia does far more than just drug testing to combat doping in sport.  

Gathering information is an important part of the work we do to investigate potential ADRVs. As we know from the ADRV module, testing positive is only one way to get caught out.

## Gathering Intelligence
Sport Integrity Australia receives information from a variety of sources, and this information is assessed for its reliability and accuracy. Already known information from other sources is added to the new information to create ‘intelligence’. Think of it like a jigsaw puzzle! 

This intelligence can lead to other action by Sport Integrity Australia such as a testing mission, an education session, or an anti-doping investigation. An investigation is a search for the truth, which is why we make sure to gather the pieces of the jigsaw from many different sources so we can get the full picture.

## Where does information and intelligence come from?
- Members of the public
- Members of the sporting community, such as athletes and support personnel
- Other government agencies
- National sporting organisations
- Law enforcement agencies

## CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS
### Who do we investigate?
Sport Integrity Australia investigates possible ADRVs by any member of the sporting community. Members of the sporting community can be under investigation without ever having been drug tested, and can be under investigation without knowing it.

### How do we investigate?
The role of the investigator is to gather sufficient, reliable and admissible evidence to prove or disprove ADRVs. This is achieved by interviewing athletes, support persons or witnesses, or through physical evidence such as mobile phones, laptops or the substance itself.

A person can choose to volunteer evidence, or Sport Integrity Australia may use its legal powers to issue a Disclosure Notice.  

Disclosure Notices can require any person to do one or more of the following:
- Attend an interview to answer questions
- Give information
- Produce documents or things (a legal term meaning pretty much anything!)

Let’s look at exactly who can be investigated or be part of an investigation.
### Athletes:
Any athlete, regardless of age, sport and competition level can be investigated for breaching their sport’s anti-doping policy. Athletes can be investigated without ever having been drug tested.

### Coaches and Support Staff:
Coaches and support staff can be investigated just like athletes. As we know, there are seven anti-doping rule violations that coaches and support staff can be sanctioned for: 

Tampering and Attempted Tampering, Possession, Trafficking or Attempted Trafficking, Administration or Attempted Administration, Complicity or Attempted Complicity, Prohibited Association and Retaliation.

### Non-Participants:
Other people involved in sport, like board members, directors, officers, and anyone who is part of the doping control process, can be investigated too. Just like coaches and support staff, they are bound by the seven anti-doping rules listed previously.

### The Public:
Whilst anyone who falls outside of the jurisdiction of the sporting community, such as chemists and the general public (cannot be sanctioned for any anti-doping rule violations), they may still be considered a witness in an investigation, or be required to provide information, documents and things to Sport Integrity Australia under a Disclosure Notice.

## Scenario
Let's have a look at a case where no one tested positive:

An athlete orders a supplement online and is getting it delivered from Europe:

**Intelligence:** When the package arrives in Australia, Border Force selects the package for inspection, discovers that it contains a prohibited substance (anabolic steroids), and advises Sport Integrity Australia.

**Investigation:** Sport Integrity Australia investigates further and discover the person receiving the package is an athlete involved in sport.

## HOW CAN YOU HELP?
So, what are your responsibilities when it comes to reporting a doping incident? And what can you do to help prevent doping?

**Reporting Suspicious Activity:** If you notice anything that seems suspicious that you think might be related to doping, you can contact Sport Integrity Australia by:  

Email: reporting@sportintegrity.gov.au

Phone: 1300 027 232

Website: sportintegrity.gov.au

You can also report by using the 'Report an Issue' option from the Sport Integrity App.

Reporting can be completely anonymous.

### Remember your role and responsibilities:
Athletes, coaches and support staff all have responsibilities under the Code to report any incidents of doping that they become aware of. If you are aware of a doping incident and you don't report it, you could face sanction for complicity. That could be a four-year ban for covering up for someone else.

Consider a scenario where you do not to report an incident of doping and that person either takes your spot on the team or wins over everyone else - how would you feel then?

## REMEMBER
- Sport Integrity Australia investigates potential ADRVs by all members of the sporting community.
- Sport Integrity Australia works closely with a number of sources to form intelligence, including the police, other government agencies, anti-doping organisations from around the world, sporting bodies, and the general public.
- If you suspect someone of being involved in doping, you have a responsibility to report to Sport Integrity Australia, and this can be done anonymously.

# The Sport Integrity App
We’ve learned a lot in this course so far, how are you going to remember it all? 

Don’t worry, the Sport Integrity App is your one stop shop for all things anti-doping! 

Gone are the days of having to use multiple websites and forms, we’ve gathered everything you need to make informed choices.

The app includes plenty of useful features.
## 1. Supplement Checker:
Before you buy a supplement, search thousands of batch-tested supplements available in Australia, or check how risky a specific supplement is.

## 2. Medication Checker:
Head straight to GlobalDro by tapping the Medication Checker tile. From here you can look up any medication you use to make sure it’s safe for use in sport BEFORE you take it.

## 3. TUE Checker:
Check if a medication you use requires a TUE in-advance, or at all, and access the TUE application form by tapping the TUE Checker tile.

## 4. Report an Issue:
It could be doping, corruption, fraud, match-fixing or harassment. This can be done anonymously.

## SO NOW WHAT?
Now that you know all the important details about anti-doping, here are four things you can do to protect yourself, and do your part to keep Australian sport clean, safe and fair.

1. **Download the Sport Integrity App and have a play!** Check out all the super handy features so you know how to use them. Make sure you test out the supplement checker!
2. **Make a list of any medications you use,** especially any that you use regularly or for an ongoing condition. Check them on GlobalDro to make sure they’re safe for use in sport and use the Therapeutic Use Exemption checker to see if you need a TUE.
3. **Don’t use any supplements that aren’t batch tested.** The App includes thousands of low risk supplement batches, for things like protein powders, pre-workouts, electrolytes and vitamins. Anything that isn’t batch tested just isn't worth the risk.
4. **Get the conversation started.** Talk about anti-doping with your teammates and colleagues. You could talk about your sport’s anti-doping policy, the sample collection process, or why anti-doping is so important to you and sport.
5. **Speak up if you have a concern.** Is there anything happening in your sport that you think should be reported? Remember, you can report anonymously to Sport Integrity Australia if you don’t feel comfortable sharing your concerns with someone in your sport.
6. **Check out the other Sport Integrity Courses and Resources available.** We also publish a short Annual Update every year, so you can keep up to date with new changes and threats each year.
7. **Follow us on social media.** The App includes links to Sport Integrity Australia’s Instagram, twitter and Facebook pages. We post regular updates for athletes so you can keep up to date on all things anti-doping.
