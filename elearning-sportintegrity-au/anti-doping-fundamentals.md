# ANTI-DOPING OVERVIEW
## What is Doping?
Doping is the use of substances or methods that are banned in sport. Doping is cheating because it gives one athlete an advantage over others. Doping is also extremely dangerous to your health and can destroy your reputation.

## So, what is Anti-Doping?
Anti-doping is a set of rules designed to protect athletes’ rights to participate in sport free of performance enhancing drugs. It’s anti-doping that keeps sport fair and keeps the playing field level. When athletes choose not to dope, we say they compete clean.

## Why does clean sport matter?
Clean fair sport is about creating an equal playing field for all athletes. It's about ensuring that athletes are rewarded for their hard work dedication skill and talent and it's about ensuring that sport remains about competing in a sport that you love rather than achieving a result by any means possible. Following the anti-doping rules and understanding the importance of drug testing is important in order to catch cheats and protect clean athletes. Clean fair sport is not only important in protecting the health and safety of athletes but also in ensuring that all of our hard work that goes into training and performing on competition day isn't taken away by someone who's cheating or not following the rules. I want to know that whatever my result is in a competition it's come down to my training and dedication.

## WHO MAKES THE ANTI-DOPING RULES
The anti-doping rules aren’t written by Sport Integrity Australia. The World Anti-Doping Code (the Code) is the core document which brings together anti‑doping rules and regulations. It is written by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in consultation with stakeholders, including governments, international sporting federations, and athletes around the world.

The Code is a set of international rules which apply to all athletes around the world. This means they are the same for everyone, no matter where you come from, where you compete, what level you compete at, or which sport you participate in. 

The rules are updated approximately every six years - the most recent version of the Code came into effect on 1 January 2021.

## Who is involved in Anti-Doping?
There are a range of different groups involved in anti‑doping. It is important to understand their roles and how they work together to create policies and rules that affect you.

### 1. World Anti-Doping Agency
The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) oversees the implementation of the Code, and makes sure all countries and sports that sign up to the rules are following them.

### 2. Sport Integrity Australia
Australia is one of 191 countries who are committed to the principles of the Code, and Sport Integrity Australia is responsible for implementing the rules to prevent doping in Australia and protect the sport we love! 

We conduct testing, investigate possible doping cases, are involved in legal proceedings, and educate Australian athletes and support staff about anti-doping.

### 3. National Sporting Organisations (NSO)
National Sporting Organisations (NSOs) have their own anti‑doping policies which are compliant with the Code, Sport Integrity Australia's requirements, and their International Federation’s requirements. 

NSOs are responsible for enforcing any bans on their athletes and support staff, to keep their sport clean.

### 4. YOU
All members of sport are bound by the anti‑doping policy of their NSO, and are therefore protected by the rules. This ensures all athletes compete in a safe and fair environment.

International Federations (IFs) and Major Games also have their own Code-compliant anti-doping policies. These are applicable to each sport, or during major events like the Olympics and Commonwealth Games.

## DID YOU KNOW?
It’s not just athletes who need to know the rules! Over half of the anti-doping rules apply to coaches and support staff too.

- If an athlete dopes, they have an unfair advantage over their competitors, so it’s important that the rules apply to them.
- Coaches can have a major influence on an athlete’s decision making about anti‑doping issues. Coaches could help, or force, their athletes to dope. It’s important that the rules apply to coaches too because it is their responsibility to improve their athlete’s performance fairly and safely.
- Like coaches, support staff play a vital role in an athlete’s career. They help treat and manage injuries, provide dietary advice, manage or lead teams, and help athletes maintain their health and fitness. Support staff have a responsibility to ensure any advice they give and any medications or products that they recommend adhere to anti-doping rules, because this can impact the athlete’s health and safety.

People who aren’t athletes or support staff may be bound by the rules too. This includes, but isn’t limited to, high performance staff, board members, and even Sport Integrity Australia staff. 

Everyone is included in the rules to make sure sport stays clean, safe and fair at all levels, for all people involved.

## REMEMBER
1. WADA, Sport Integrity Australia and sporting organisations work together to create and administer the anti-doping policies and rules that affect you.
2. The World Anti-Doping Code is the document that makes sure athletes in all sports and all countries are bound by the same rules.
3. Athletes, coaches and support staff all have rights and responsibilities when it comes to anti-doping.

# The Rules
This module covers the anti-doping rules all members of sport must follow. You need to know this to make sure you don't accidentally break a rule and face a ban without knowing it.

In this section, and others, you may see new words that are important to explain before we continue:
- ‘Prohibited’ means something CAN’T be used or IS NOT allowed (e.g. a prohibited substance or method)
- ‘Permitted’ means something CAN be used or IS allowed (e.g. a permitted substance or method)
- ‘Methods’ are ways that substances are used or given (e.g. through injection, inhaler, IV etc.)
- ‘Anti-Doping Rule Violations’ are the 11 anti-doping rules that can lead to a Sanction.
- ‘Sanction’ means the penalties that apply if you break a rule.

There are eleven anti-doping rules, known as Anti-Doping Rule Violations. Lets have a look at each one:

## 1. Presence
### Test positive for a prohibited substance 
**Example:**
An athlete was tested and returned a positive result for Higenamine. As Higenamine is prohibited, the athlete was banned from sport because it was present in their sample. 

This rule applies to athletes only.

## 2. Use or Attemped use
### Use or attempted use of a prohibited substance or method 
**Example:**
The athlete ordered Clenbuterol online. Clenbuterol is prohibited so when Border Force found the package, they informed us. After an investigation, the athlete received a ban from the sport for attempted use of a prohibited substance. 

This rule applies to athletes only.

## 3. Evasion or Refusal
### Evading testing, refusing or failing to provide a sample 
**Example:**
An athlete was notified that they had been selected for doping control however refused to be tested. The athlete was banned from sport for refusing to provide a sample without a compelling justification.

This rule applies to athletes only.

## 4. Whereabouts
### A combination of three missed tests and/or filing failures within 12 months (for Registered Testing Pool athletes)
**Example:**
An athlete on the Registered Testing Pool (RTP) advised they would be available for testing at their home, every day between 7-8am. When testing staff arrived at this time, the athlete wasn’t home and a “missed test” was declared. The athlete already had two missed tests declared within the last 12 months, and this was the 3rd, so the athlete was banned from sport for having three whereabouts failures in a 12 month period.

This rule applies to athletes on a Registered Testing Pool (RTP).

## 5. Tempering
### Tampering or attempted tampering with any part of the doping control process
**Example:**
A coach intimidated doping control officials, refused to allow her athlete to be tested and then drove her home. The coach was banned from all sport for tampering with the doping control process. In this case, the athlete may have also received a ban from sport for refusing or failing to provide a sample. 

This rule applies to athletes and other persons bound by the Code.

## 6. Possession
### Possession of a prohibited substance or method 
**Example:**
An athlete was returning from an international competition when their bag was searched by Border Force. A prohibited substance was found in their luggage and, as they did not have an approved TUE, the athlete was banned from sport for the possession of a prohibited substance.

This rule applies to athletes and support staff.

## 7. Trafficking
### Trafficking or attempted trafficking of a prohibited substance or method 
**Example:**
A coach ordered a large quantity of prohibited substances online with plans to give them to his athletes. Border Force found the package and the coach was banned from sport for attempted trafficking. 

This rule applies to athletes and athlete support persons bound by the Code.

## 8. Administration
### Administration or attempted administration of a prohibited substance or method 
**Example:**
An athlete receives a blood transfusion from a team doctor to improve her performance. The team doctor could be banned from sport for administration.

This rule applies to athletes and other persons bound by the Code.

## 9. Complicity
### Complicity or attempted complicity
**Example:**
The manager of a team knows his athletes are doping. When testing officials arrive, the manager tells the athletes to leave so they won’t be tested. The manager could be banned from sport for complicity.

This rule applies to athletes and other persons bound by the Code.

## 10. Prohibited association
### Knowingly associating in a sporting context with an athlete support person who is serving a ban
**Example:**
A coach has been banned from sport for breaking one of the rules. The athlete is aware that the coach has been banned, and the athlete continues to receive coaching from this coach. The athlete may receive a ban from sport for prohibited association.

This rule applies to athletes and other persons bound by the Code.

## 11. Acts to discourage or retaliate against reporting
### Acts to discourage or retaliate against reporting to authorities
**Example:** An athlete sees their teammate using a prohibited substance. The athlete tells their teammate that they will report this to Sport Integrity Australia, and the teammate threatens to harm the athlete if they report it. The teammate may receive a ban from sport for discouraging against reporting.

This rule applies to athletes and other persons bound by the Code.

## THE STRICT LIABILITY PRINCIPLE
As an athlete, you might be thinking ‘but what if...’
- Someone gave it to me?
- I didn't know?
- My doctor prescribed it?

None of these excuses matter much.

It is the athlete’s responsibility to know the rules and to know what is going in their body at all times. This is called the Strict Liability Principle: athletes are held responsible for anything found in their bodies, regardless of how it got there.

Let's look at those reasons in more details:

## 1. Someone gave it to me
As an athlete, you are responsible for whatever is found in your sample - even if your coach, parent (or anyone else) gives it to you or says it’s OK.

You need to check every substance you put in your body before you use it.

## 2. I didn't know
As an athlete, you should know. In fact, you need to know! It is your responsibility to check everything BEFORE you use it.

## 3. It was prescribed to me
You might be prescribed a substance to treat a medical condition. Just because a substance has been prescribed does NOT mean it is permitted.

The Strict Liability Principle is important because it stops people from cheating and getting away with it by just blaming someone else. If you have a prohibited substance in your body, you will be held responsible for it and will have to explain how it got there.

## REMEMBER
- There are 11 Anti-Doping Rule Violations – all 11 apply to athletes and 7 apply to other persons bound by the Code.
- **STRICT LIABILITY** one the of the most important things to remember: an athlete is responsible for all substances found in their sample and will face the consequences if a prohibited substance is found.

# Prohibited substances and methods
In this module, you will learn about the Prohibited List, and how to find out if a substance or method is banned in sport. You need to know this to make sure you (or your athletes) don’t take a banned substance by accident.

## The Prohibited List
Each year, WADA publishes the Prohibited List, which identifies the substances and methods that are prohibited in sport. 

Before we find out more about prohibited substances and methods, let's listen to how a substance is selected for the Prohibited List.

## How does a substance end up on the prohibited list?
Prohibited list contains a broad range of substances from things like salbutamol in a ventilated puffer which is quite a common medication through to substances that haven't even cleared clinical trails like ASSAM. There are three criteria that are considered and a substance has to meet two of those three criteria to get onto the list.
